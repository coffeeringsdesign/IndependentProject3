# _Meet the Tin Specters_

#### _Enter numbers and they are returned in Robot mumbo jumbo, 08/17/18_

#### By _**Kendra Kelly**_

## Description

_A basic exercise in javascript to allow the user to input numbers and get back beeps and boops and other replies accordint to 0,1, & 3's_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know?  Outline any issues that would impact use of your application.  Share any workarounds that are in place. }_

## Objectives

_JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.

Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).

Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.

All previous objectives have been met.

Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.

Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.

Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.

Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

Application implements a loop and works as expected._

## Specifications

Program recognized NaN and replies back asking for a number
Example: thisismynumber
Output: ["Please enter a number."]

Program limits the amount of numbers that can be entered
Example: 0 4 5666
Output: ["Please enter a single number."]

Program replaces a single "0" with a "Beep!"
Example: 0
Output: ["Beep!"]

Program replaces a single "1" with a "Boop!"
Example: 1
Output: ["Boop!"]

Program replaces a single "3" with a "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
Example: 3
Output: ["I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."]

If the entire number includes a "0" the whole thing is replaced with a "Beep!"
Example: 60006
Output: ["Beep!"]

If the entire number includes a "1" the whole thing is replaced with a "Boop!"
Example: 511
Output: ["Boop!"]

If the number is divisible by "3"" the whole this is replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
Example: 15
Output: ["I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."]

Once a number is submitted the output shows every number counting up to that number replaced according to the specs above.
Example: 4
Output: Boop!, 2, I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that, 4

## Technologies Used

_{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}_
