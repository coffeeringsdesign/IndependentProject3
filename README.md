## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _use atom to edit html , js & css files_
* _Chrome to see user interface_
* _I recommend Github for version control_

## Known Bugs

_It isn't yet working_

## Objectives

_JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.

Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).

Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.

All previous objectives have been met.

Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.

Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.

Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.

Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

Application implements a loop and works as expected._
